# DengAI
Machine Learning Project predicting Dengue Fever cases

# Introduction
During the UK Lockdown of Summer 2020, with the Covid-19 Pandemic at it's Peak, I, like most of the nation, was taking a greater than normal intereset in Health and Epidemiology. Having started by looking into some Covid data (which at the time was fairly limited and extremely unreliable), I came across the DengAI Driven Data competition. The task was to predict local epidemics of Dengue Fever in two South American cities; San Juan, Puerto Rico and Iquitos, Peru. Keen to excercise and increase my machine learning capabilites, I entered the tournament.
